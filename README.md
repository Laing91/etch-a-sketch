This project was started after following The Odin Project course online.

Grid would make more sense (using Grid to make a Grid), however the challenge of this project was to build it using Flexbox.

Once I learn more advanced teachings (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), I'll come back to this project and add more to it.

To-do:

- Add either a resize button, or a resize togglebar.
- Add an option to change the colors used.
